    <img src="image\Natsuki Subaru zlo.jpg">

    <p>While Subaru tends to not read the situations he encounters, ultimately leading him to make irrational decisions,
    he is loyal to those he holds dear, willing to help them, even if that means taking the thorny path.</p>
    <p> He had his resolve confirmed through the many situations and circumstances he faces in the fantasy world, originally having 
        been one to always take the 'easy' route. As a shut-in NEET, he was hopeful of the possibilities that being sucked into a new realm brings, but later realizes the realities of the predicament he is in.</p>
        <p> Eventually, he resolves himself to be faithful and protective of the ones that he cares most about.

        Beneath his eccentric demeanor, however, Subaru is actually a very insecure person suffering from a severe inferiority complex due to growing up in his father's shadow.</p>
        <p> This also caused him to develop a fundamental misunderstanding of relationships where he believed he would be abandoned if he wasn't the center-of-attention.</p>
         <p>Even his otaku-tendencies were really just another method he used to stand out. Ironically, though, 
            these desperate attempts to connect to others only caused him to make a fool of himself and push others away. 
            It wasn't until he was transported to Lugunica that Subaru finally met people who accept him for who he is
             and he began learning how to build genuine relations.</p>

        <p>Subaru is first seen at a local Japanese convenience store, buying consumer goods. After leaving the store,
             he somehow ends up in a fantasy world, after the atmosphere around him distorts itself. 
            Confused by the happenings around him, Subaru later realizes that he has been sucked into another world.</p>

            <p>Back in his original world, Subaru was the only son to two odd, but well-meaning parents, Kenichi and Naoko.
                 From a young childhood age, Subaru idealized his dad in particular, a popular man in his community who was highly
                  talented in whatever he did, a loving father who prioritized his family above everything else, and had a boisterous 
                  personality that charmed anyone he met. Kenichi was everything he wanted to be and growing 
                  up around him had a huge influence on Subaru's life. Taking pride in being his son, Subaru worked to
                   live up to the expectations that came with that in his mind. For a time, he achieved this, as Subaru
                    found himself smarter, more physically able, and popular than his peers. When he received praise,
                     Subaru would of hear how it was expected of him being Kenichi's son,
                 which made him feel special and entitled to a sense of superiority.</p>

                <p>However, as the young boy's small world started to gradually expand upon entering middle school, Subaru would come
                     face to face with limits of his own ability. Suddenly, he found people who were becoming smarter and faster than he 
                     was and, in general, being better at the things he used to be. He felt as if he was slowly losing his place
                      and began to harbor a deep sense of shame at letting down his parents and fear of
                       everyone leaving him for failures, doubt and self-loathing began to develop in his 
                       heart. But rather than prioritizing getting better at those things to combat his anxieties, 
                       Subaru instead placed more importance on doing daring and outrageous things to maintain his fragile dignity
                        and keep himself the center of attention. However, the more reckless Subaru's actions became, the fewer people
                         wanted to be around him. Yet Subaru continued to deceive himself and believe his own lies because as the son
                          of his seemly indomitable father, he couldn't be seen as a failure. Eventually, one day,
                     Subaru noticed he no longer had any friends and in his loneliness, Subaru realized he wasn't anyone special.</p>

                     <p>From then on, the comparisons between his father and himself turned
                         into a curse that wounded and suffocated him everywhere he went, yet his strong admiration 
                         for his dad made it impossible to show that pain to anyone. Eventually, he stopped trying 
                         to stand out and when high school came, he found himself in a new environment where no one
                          knew his past. Seizing this opportunity, Subaru tried to build new interpersonal relationships,
                           but he had no idea how to be himself around others and instead only ended up emulating his father,
                            his only frame of reference which instead led to others to treat him as a clown and classmates simply 
                            ignored his existence altogether. One day, Subaru skipped a day of school out of lack of enthusiasm, 
                            which slowly turned into a constant thing until at one point, he hadn't been to class for three months.
                             When out of public spaces, Subaru felt liberated, but more than that, his own degradation meant people would
                              start distancing him from Kenichi and in a twisted sense of hope,
                         his parents come to acknowledge him as worthless and cast him aside in self-abandonment.</p>

                         <p>After being summoned to a new world, he saw this as a chance to make 
                            a fresh start; however, he didn't change as a person. He decided that he would save Emilia,
                             and eventually, he was exposed for what he was, a person forcing their feelings on someone
                             else, and that his white-knighting doesn't work out in the real world. He thought of himself 
                            as the hero of his own story, but was faced with reality when he didn't have the overpowered 
                            abilities of a usual protagonist, he however chose to ignore that he wasn't the hero and that 
                            the world would go on with or without and tried to force his way into Emilia's affairs, and in 
                            the process making a complete fool of himself.</p>

                            <p>The world then proceeded to show him how weak he was, and that he couldn't save
                                anyone, after being utterly broken, he wanted to run away but was however stopped 
                               by Rem. This became the turning point for his character; he truly made an effort
                                to change himself rather than expect that as the supposed protagonist, everything
                                would work out, which it didn't before as he had to watch the results of his failures
                                and see the people he cared for die over and over again. Eventually after hitting
                                his breaking point and coming to terms with his inter conflicts with some encouraging 
                               words from Rem, Subaru began reflect on his actions and take step to amend his broken 
                               relationships, ultimately learned to be better considerate of Emilia's feelings 
                               rather than just forcing his in expectation that she would reward him.
                                Subaru indeed became a changed character, and he also now tries to live
                                up to the expectations of a hero that Rem had for him.</p>

                                <p>According to the author, after Subaru went missing (was transported to the Kingdom of Lugunica), 
                                    a police investigation was launched but ended up empty-handed.</p>

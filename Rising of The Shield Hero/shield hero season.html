    <h3>Naofumi Iwatani biography</h3>

    <p>Naofumi Iwatani (岩谷尚文 Iwatani Naofumi?) is the protagonist of The Rising of the Shield Hero series. 
        He was summoned to another world to serve as the Shield Hero (盾の勇者 Tate no Yuusha?), one of the Four Legendary Heroes.</p>

    <p>Naofumi was initially an exceedingly trusting and positive person - excited about being summoned as a hero. 
        However, his mentality abruptly changed after Malty S Melromarc, the princess of Melromarc, betrayed and framed him.</p>

    <p>Being left near-penniless, falsely accused as a criminal, and hated by nearly everyone, Naofumi became extremely distrustful
        towards everyone and cynical about life. He could not trust anyone and started to assume that others were trying to get something from him.
        The result of the Princess's betrayal has left him in an almost permanent state of anger and hostility, which he masks behind a calm and
        level-headed personality.</p>

    <p>After losing nearly everything, Naofumi deeply values what he has built up since being summoned, especially his relationships.
        Therefore, he is protective of people like Raphtalia.</p>

    <p>Naofumi is a pragmatist and is willing to take some unconventional measures to meet his goals.</p>

    <p>One of the biggest differences that Naofumi has from the other heroes is that he thinks of the consequences of his actions.</p>

    <p>Naofumi has a habit of giving people he meets nicknames.</p>

        <h3 >Naofumi Iwatani biography</h3>

        <p>Naofumi Iwatani (岩谷尚文 Iwatani Naofumi?) is the protagonist of The Rising of the Shield Hero series. 
            He was summoned to another world to serve as the Shield Hero (盾の勇者 Tate no Yuusha?),
             one of the Four Legendary Heroes.</p>

            <h3 >Personality</h3>
            
            <p>Naofumi was initially an exceedingly trusting and positive person 
                - excited about being summoned as a hero. However, his mentality 
                abruptly changed after Malty S Melromarc, the princess of Melromarc, 
                betrayed and framed him.</p>

                <p>Being left near-penniless, falsely accused as a criminal,
                    and hated by nearly everyone, Naofumi became extremely distrustful
                    towards everyone and cynical about life. He could not trust anyone
                    and started to assume that others were trying to get something from him.
                    The result of the Princess's betrayal has left him in an almost
                    permanent state of anger and hostility, which he masks behind a calm and
                    level-headed personality. This mentality bites him back as he unknowingly 
                   pushes away genuine supporters of the Shield Hero and Siltvelt envoys.</p>

                   <p>Unfortunately, being a Shield Hero meant that Naofumi
                    was essentially useless by himself, which forced him to
                    eventually seek help. He was convinced to get a slave -
                    someone who could not betray him - so he eventually finds
                    Raphtalia. Naofumi treats her deadly illness and teaches
                    her to fight. After spending time with Raphtalia, and
                    eventually Filo, Naofumi starts to heal mentally and 
                   trust his close companions. However, this is a long 
                   process and Naofumi is still unable to fully trust or be
                    intimate with others. Unlocking the curse series weapon
                    Shield of Wrath also placed a block on his psyche which 
                   prevented him from empathizing with others.</p>

                   <p>After losing nearly everything, Naofumi deeply values what
                    he has built up since being summoned, especially his relationships.
                    Therefore, he is protective of people like Raphtalia.
                    It is also shown several times that Naofumi is at his most 
                   vulnerable when he loses someone close to him. This can be seen
                    when Naofumi thought he had lost Raphtalia after losing the 
                   Duel with Motoyasu, and when he was separated from Raphtalia and
                    the rest of his party he traveled to Glass' World. He was even willing
                    to sacrifice his life to save his friends such as when they were battling 
                   against the Phoenix or Takt.</p>

                   <p>Naofumi is a pragmatist and is willing to take some unconventional 
                    measures to meet his goals. For example, after saving Rishia and Keel,
                     he offers both of them to be his slave since the shield helps improves
                     a persons growth and stats. Once becoming governor of the territory
                     which includes Raphtalia's destroyed village, Lurolona Village, Naofumi
                     purchases slaves to be villagers. He justifies this saying that this will
                     give them a better life and that it will help them gain independence.
                     Due to their good treatment and their respect of Naofumi, the children 
                    end up adoring him. At one point, Rishia wonders if Naofumi's commitment
                     to the villagers make him their slave instead of the other way around.</p>

                     <p>Subconsciously, Naofumi often feels unworthy of what he has 
                        and tries to deny certain things. This can be seen in his constant
                         ignoring of Raphtalia's romantic feelings due to feeling unworthy of her.
                         This also shows in his addiction to Raph-chan which - in his own words - he only
                         likes so much due to its resemblance to Raphtalia herself. He often feels 
                        vulnerable about certain actions he takes which can be seen often when Raphtalia
                         points out the absurdity of some of them. He has feelings for Raphtalia for
                         many reasons, including her being the light that brought him out of the darkness 
                        of his life. He considers her a hero for being the one person to stay by his
                         side even after everyone despised him.</p>

                         <p>One of the biggest differences that Naofumi has from 
                            the other heroes is that he thinks of the consequences of 
                            his actions. Despite having the most villainous attitude,
                             Naofumi is ironically the most effective of the heroes at 
                            getting things done. He even corrects the problems that
                             the other three heroes either start or make worse. Another 
                            aspect of Naofumi that sets him apart is that he is generally
                             reasonable and willing to listen to others. He was convinced
                             to stay in Melromarc after listening to the arguments of the
                             queen. He also attempted to amend his relationship with the 
                            other heroes at Fitoria's request despite their mutual hatred. 
                            When Naofumi became loved and adored by the public while the
                             three other Heroes became hated by the same people that use to 
                            admire them, he decided to take them under his wing.</p>

                            <p>Naofumi has a habit of giving people he meets nicknames. 
                                His reasons tend to be because they didn't tell him their name 
                                or because he hates them. In the latter case, he will give them 
                                extremely degrading nicknames such as referring to Malty as Bitch.
                                 For most people, he tends to nickname them based off of who or 
                                what they remind him of, sometimes add a number if he feels they 
                                act a lot like someone he knows. After Naofumi became the Mirror
                                 Vassal Hero of Glass' world, his friends note it suited him given
                                 how he always 'reflects' other people's treatment of him right back
                                 at them, insulting those whom insulted him first and helping those whom
                                 helped him.</p>
